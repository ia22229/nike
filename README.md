## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** this repository:

🎨 Customization Tips
Global Colors: At the top of style.css, adjust the CSS variables (--primary, --accent, etc.) to match your branding.

Typography: Change font‑family under the body selector or link to external fonts (e.g., Google Fonts).

Layout Sections: Duplicate or remove <section> blocks in index.html to add or hide content.

JavaScript Hooks: Look for elements with data- attributes in main.js to extend functionality (e.g., scroll animations, modals).
